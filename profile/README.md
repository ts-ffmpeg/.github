## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is the ts-ffmpeg team. 
We are aim to provide a stable typescript lib for ffmpeg, follow the former fluent-ffmpeg lib.

Try out `@ts-ffmpeg/fluent-ffmpeg` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-ffmpeg/fluent-ffmpeg), which is fully compatible with `fluent-ffmpeg`, but with types in it.
Code comtrubution or new issues are also welcome on https://github.com/ts-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg.
